# fcul-bbc-latex-template-thesis-2016
LatTeX template for dissertations done in the Master's on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at FCUL (Faculty Of Sciences University Of Lisbon). Probably easy to adapt to other courses.

I've tried to follow [the rules document published in 2016](http://bmg.fc.ul.pt/Info/Leis/pos-grad/Regulam%20Mestrados%20FCUL%202016.pdf). Adapted from older template done by [TODO].
