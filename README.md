# fcul-bbc-latex-template-thesis-2016
LatTeX template for dissertations done in the Master's on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at FCUL (Faculty Of Sciences University Of Lisbon). Probably easy to adapt to other courses.

I've tried to follow the rules document published in 2016](https://github.com/LLCampos/fcul-bbc-latex-template-thesis-2016/blob/master/Regulam%20Mestrados%20FCUL%202016.pdf). Adapted from an older template done by André Lamúrias.

Pull request your improvements/corrections so that any student can improve from them. :)
